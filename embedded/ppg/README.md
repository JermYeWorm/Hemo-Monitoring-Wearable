# PPG Front End Firmware

This directory contains jumpstarter resources for MAXM86146 firmware development. The MAXM86146 is pre-flashed with a programmable bootloader, and requires manual programming of an .msbl hex file via I2C to access application mode.
<br><br>
An .msbl flashing application can be found in "MAX32630FTHR_msbl_flasher" (requires external MAX32630FTHR board and 3.3V to 1.8V level shifter).

"MAX32664C_33.13.31_MAXM86146.zip" contains the latest documentation from Maxim Integrated on the internal MAX32664C MCU.
